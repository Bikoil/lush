### What is lush?
- Lush is an Open Source CLI shell written in lua that is accessible across all platforms such as Linux, Windows, BSD, and MacOS and more!

### Why is lush named that?
- Well it's simple, lua + shell = lush, or lua + sh = lush, really simple name that came into my mind lol

### What stage of development is lush in?
- Lush is currently still being designed and planned, and is not ready for use at all

### When will lush come out?
- There is no official release date sadly, Im the only one currently working on the project

### What is the main idea behind lush?
- The main idea behind lush is to run on almost every OS out there to unite them all into one shell, with almost no different looks or anything between each OS's version of lush

### What OS's are planned to have lush released on?
- Lush will be released on all the following OS's in this specific order
  - Linux (Arch then other distros)
  - BSD (FreeBSD then other variants)
  - Windows (Windows 10-11 and maybe older)
  - MacOS (Don't really know much about Mac versions)
